"<p>The music player can be started by navigating to Audio in the main "
"menu and activating a music file. The music player UI will be displayed. "
"By default all music files from current directory will be added to the "
"playlist, so you can switch the tracks without moving back to the "
"directory with music. The player is designed to work in background, so "
"you can switch to another application any time. In order to "
"pause/continue playback press play/stop button.</p> \n"
